== description

   For Vi, Vim or GVim users, there is a simple way to manage your blog posts. Under Vim environment, you can create new blog posts, edit, list all categories, list older posts, delete posts, turn Published into Draft posts, and vice-versa.
   It is out-of-the-box working for Wordpress, but very easilly, you can make it manage Blogger, MovableType, TextPattern, etc, platforms. Its the beauty of Open Source software. Study the code, change it, and use it. It is very safe to use it because unlike proprietary software, you can check for “phone_home” procedures, etc.

==  requirements:

   * you'll need VIM compiled with Ruby scripting support
     - example: for Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install vim-ruby
   * please, copy this file to one of your VIM dir
     - example: to your .vim home folder: $HOME/.vim/vimlog.vim
   * please, add this code to your .vimrc file:

       if !exists('*Wordpress_vim')
         runtime vimblog.vim
       endif

   * change your blog login/password info on the get_personal_data
     function bellow. 
   * make sure you have xmlrpc.php file in your / blog dir. If not, 
     change the @xml variable to find it.
   * testing: open vim, ando do 
       :Blog rp 
     to get your recent 10 posts.

== how-to

   * copy the script to your Vim scripts path, $HOME/.vim directory
   * edit you .vimrc (if not exists, create it: $HOME/.vimrc) and insert:

if !exists('*Wordpress_vim')
runtime vimblog.vim
endif

   * open the vimblog.vim script and edit the personal data in def get_personal_data method approx. at line 97.
   * @site value, do not insert “http://”. Just insert the blog address, like in my case “blog.tquadrado.com”
   * @xml value, insert the path to your blog’s xmlrpc.php file. If, like in my case, it is in / from your blog address, do insert “/xmlrpc.php”
   * run Vim and try fetching the last 10 posts by doing:

:Blog rp

If you can see them, it’s fine. If not, test this:

   * check if the script is being found, by typing :B + TAB key. Upon code completion, it is ok. Remember, capital B.
   * if error persist, check for the correct path for xmlrpc.php in @xml value.
